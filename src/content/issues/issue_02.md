Hello everyone! Welcome to the new and improved daily drip, I have lots planned for the future but lets kick off the first issue of The Daily Drip with some new leaks on Penacony

# Acheron
We just got some new leaks for Acheron, a Lightning Nihility unit, and her kit is a little complicated to say the least. ^1

## Talent
Acheron starts with 0 **Flowers**. She does not use energy and cannot receive energy. Her actions apply **Flowers** to enemies until a total of 9 are on the field. When an enemy dies, their remaining **Flowers** are transferred to the enemy with the most **Flowers**. At max **Flowers**, she gains the ability to ult.

## Normal
Performs a single target attack against an enemy. The target of the attack receives 1 **Flower**.

## Skill
Performs a blast attack against the enemies. The primary target of this attack receives 2 **Flowers**. 

## Ultimate
Acheron reduces the **Damage RES** of all enemies during the duration of the ultimate. All attacks performed during this ultimate will ignore Weakness Types. Acheron performs 4 distinct actions in quick succession:

1. Perform a 2-hit attack against the enemy with the most flowers, reducing their flower count by 3. Perform an AoE attack with the damage ratio scaled based on the number of flowers that were reduced. 
2. Perform a 3-hit attack against the enemy with the most flowers, reducing their flower count by 3. Perform an AoE attack with the damage ratio scaled based on the number of flowers that were reduced. 
3. Perform a 1-hit attack against the enemy with the most flowers, reducing their flower count by 3. Perform an AoE attack with the damage ratio scaled based on the number of flowers that were reduced. 
4. Perform a 2-hit attack AoE attack against all enemies.

## Technique
Upon entering combat, Acheron generates +?? flowers applied to the highest ranking enemy. Performs an AoE attack against all enemies.

## Ascensions 
**A2**: Upon entering combat, Acheron generates +?? flowers applied to the highest ranking enemy.
**A4**: If there is at least 1 Nihility teammate in the party, increase the damage of all Acheron's attacks by ??%. If there is at least 2 Nihility teammates, increase the damage of all Acheron's attacks by ??%.
**A6**: When a **Flower** is consumed during the ult, apply a DMG% buff to Acheron for ?? turns (max ?? stacks).

## Eidolons
**E1**: When a debuff is applied to an enemy, boost Acheron's ATK% and CRIT Rate (Crit Chance%) until the end of the encounter. Max ?? stacks.
E2: Reduces the A4 Nihility requirement by 1. At the beginning of Acheron's turn, 1 flower is added to the enemy with the most flowers.
E4: At the start of her ult, applies a debuff to all enemies increasing their damage taken by ??% for ?? turns.
E6: Acheron ults receive a ??% CRIT DMG boost. When Acheron uses a Basic ATK or Skill, it will be considered an Ultimate Attack.
