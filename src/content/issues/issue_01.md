## Neuvillette Burst Animation Description

From the makers of Neuv kit PT. I and Neuv kit PT. II, we have a translated description of his burst animation!! [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/15g68x1/neuvillette_animations_description/)

## Neuvillette’s Animations - Rough Sketch

And here we have some visuals on the animations!! Referencing the above description, someone created a rough sketch of the Burst. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/15gxczh/neuvillettes_animations_rough_sketch/)

Uncle’s comment states, the sketch is pretty accurate with the positioning cut off right at his jabot. However he swings his hand to widely in these sketches, he does more of a downwards slant in front of him to his side and he also turns slightly as his arm moves.

## Lynette Info via HomDGCat

From our favorite abyss numbers leaker, HomDGCat is back with some Lynette kit info. Her burst has a 8m taunt and her box only absorbs with it is hit with an element and the priority is **Cryo > Pyro > Hydro > Electro.** [link](https://files.catbox.moe/v4awst.png)

## Neuvillette’s Kit Pt. III

Back to Neuvillette news, a part three on the Neuvillette Kit leak!! [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/15h3f9d/neuvillettes_kit_pt_iii/)

Important things are:

1. His Burst buffs interruption resistance and adds DMG% to NAs according to the number of Hydro characters (Max 3)
2. Early con adds a +1 to this number (Similar to Nahida C1)
3. C4 & C6 buffs his personal damage, which means he does *alot* at C6
4. His interruption resistance at max buff is pretty good, similar to XQ at 0.3 (IDK what this means, C3 XQ probably?)
5. His DMG% buff is pretty good, similar to Lyney’s
